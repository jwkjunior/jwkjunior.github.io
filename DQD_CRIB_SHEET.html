  <h1>Description of DQD</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>This document provides an overview of the <strong>Delivery Quantity Distributer (DQD)</strong> and specific information on technical aspects of this application. DQD is a tool that will distribute a given quantity of contract deliverables over a given time period in accordance with several common factory deliverable profiles (flat line, ramp up, ramp down and a bell curve). For example, if a contract requires delivering 120 radios over 12 months, a <strong>"flat-line"</strong> distribution will display a result showing a 12-month period with 10 radios arriving each month.</p>

    <p>In the first screen, users enter data needed to perform the required distribution (plus some other pertinent contract-related data) and if the data is entered without errors, a <strong>"Submit"</strong> button is enabled. Clicking this button displays a second screen with the resulting distribution.</p>

<p>The second screen allows a user to make adjustments (if needed) to the system-generated distribution (for example, a factory may be closed for two weeks in December, and to make up the difference, the factory may work overtime in November and January and deliver more radios in each of those months). If there are no validation errors on the second screen, the distribution can be saved to a database by clicking a button (in this demo version of DQD, the ability to save the data to a database is not included so an error message will display if the <strong>"Save to Database"</strong> button is clicked).</p>

    <h2>The DQD Validation Framework</h2>

    <p>DQD includes an internally-developed framework for validating user inputs. This framework has been designed to be:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>As language agnostic as possible (C and JavaScript versions exist so far);</li>
      <li>Flexible enough to be easily incorporated into other applications;</li>
      <li>easily maintainable so that removing or changing existing validations, adding new validations to existing fields or adding new fields with validations is quick, easy and resistant to the introduction of coding errors;</li>
      <li>data-driven so that validation invocation, relationships and messages to display are maintained as Boolean entries in simple data structures (arrays); and</li>
      <li>lightweight and fast.</li>

    </ol>

     <p>In this usage, it is applied to the first screen where it validates user inputs, displays error messages and prevents the application from advancing until the errors are corrected. It could however, be easily applied to validate automated inputs received on a server from other systems or sensors and perform appropriate actions. </p>

    <p>Information is provided here that gives the necessary context and background to understand how the validation framework functions when it is applied to the DQD input screen. A description of the features is below, followed by some example entries that illustrate these features.</p>

    <h3>The DQD validation framework:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>allows a minimum number of characters to be entered before validation begins (e.g. entering <code>@02</code> triggers no validation in a field requiring the input of a calendar or fiscal year with four digits, appending a <code>4</code> to this input triggers an error and resulting message requiring a valid year entry);</li>
      <li>permits validations for data integrity on single fields (e.g. entering <code>t</code> instead of <code>5</code> in a quantity field triggers a message indicating that a valid integer must be entered);</li>
      <li>permits validations on relationships that involve more than one field (e.g. entering <code>50</code> for estimated speed in MPH, <code>3</code> for estimated time in hours and <code>200</code> for total distance in miles to be traveled triggers a message warning that the distance traveled exceeds the speed multiplied by the travel time);</li>
      <li>incorporates a feature that displays relevant messages where they apply so that as the user clicks around the screen, messages that can be addressed in that field move with the user (e.g. using the multiple field validation described above, if the user enters <code>200</code> in the distance field as the last of the three entries, the system will highlight the field and display the message described above, however, if the user then clicks in the estimated speed field, the message now displays in the speed field, the same applies if the user doesn't fix the issue and next clicks in the estimated time field - note that messages don't move to the current field if that relationship doesn't include that field, i.e. if the user next clicked on the field requiring the entry of a valid year, the speed multiplied by hours not equaling distance traveled stays in the last active field of those three) and </li>
      <li>easily allows changing how the messages are displayed for a UI (it's easy to change from displaying them in a tooltip to displaying them in a message box: this can be readily seen by opening DQD in a desktop browser and comparing how messages are displayed there with how they are displayed when DQD is opened in a mobile browser).</li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Follow the steps below to better understand the features described above:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the initial entry screen for DQD from the DQD General Information page.</li>
      <li>Click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the FY for the contract"</strong> in the upper left, and enter an invalid entry for a year that should be in the YYYY format (e.g. <code>@024</code> or <code>tyr4</code>). The cell should be highlighted indicating an invalid entry, but notice that no validations are run until at least 4 characters are entered. Clear the error by entering a valid year that is later than the current calendar year. </li>
      <li>Click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the monthly maximum production rate"</strong> in the upper right. This field requires an integer entry so try entering <code>u</code>. Notice that the cell is highlighted and an error displays: in this case, the validation is run immediately, i.e. the minimum number of characters required before the validations are run is set to 1 for this field. Correct the entry to <code>10</code> and this will clear the error.</li>
      <li>Click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the month and calendar year for the first item delivery date"</strong> in the upper center of the screen and enter a date that is before the beginning of the FY entered in Step 2 above (e.g. for FY YYYY, enter a month and year that is earlier than 1 October of YYYY - 1). The cell should be highlighted and an error should display indicating that the first item delivery cannot occur before the FY used to fund the contract (i.e. money authorized for expenditure in a given year cannot be used to purchase items that will be delivered in an earlier year). Clear   the error by entering a date that occurs during or after the FY entered in Step 2.</li>
      <li>Click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the number of months over which deliveries will occur"</strong> in the center of the screen and enter the number <code>13</code>. The cell should be highlighted and an error should display indicating that for FYs in the future, delivery periods must be 12 months or fewer (the US Congress allocates money yearly and does not allow federal employees to obligate the government to pay for services or goods under a contract that runs for more than 12 months, note however that there are exceptions and workarounds for this). Leave this as <code>13</code> for now.</li>
      <li>Click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter total deliveries"</strong> in the lower center of the screen and enter the number <code>150</code>. This cell should be highlighted and this error message should display: <strong>"Delivery quantity cannot exceed the Maximum Monthly Production quantity multiplied by the number of months in the delivery period."</strong> This occurs because if the factory can produce at most 10 items per month, a production run of 12 months can only delivery a total of 120 items, yet the entry in this field indicates that 150 are to be delivered. Leave this entry at <code>150</code> for now.</li>
      <li>Click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the FY for the contract"</strong> in the upper left. Notice that the highlight on the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the number of months over which deliveries will occur"</strong> has been cleared and the highlight now moves to this cell. This error can be fixed in two ways: either the delivery period can be made shorter than 13 months or the fiscal year can be changed to a earlier year (contract periods can be greater than 13 months for current or prior fiscal years because they reflect reality, i.e. a contract designed to run for 12 months can experience delays for  many different reasons, e.g. a hurricane can shut down a factory for several months or a competitor can file a contract protest which results in a stop-work order). Don't make any changes in this cell.</li>
      <li>Now click back in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the number of months over which deliveries will occur"</strong>. Notice that the highlights have changed for two different cells: the last active cell from step 7 is no longer highlighted and the <strong>"Enter total deliveries"</strong> cell is no longer highlighted - only the active cell is highlighted. This occurs because two different validations across five cells share this one common cell and  both messages display on this cell because (in theory) both issues could be fixed by changing the value in this cell (in this particular example, it will take changes to entries in two cells to clear both these errors). Don't make any changes to this entry yet.</li>
      <li>Finally, click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the monthly maximum production rate"</strong> and notice that in this case, the last active cell remains highlighted and this cell has also been highlighted. In this case, the error message indicating that a future year contract cannot be more than 13 months cannot be fixed by an entry in this cell so the highlight stays on the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the number of months over which deliveries will occur"</strong> however, the error message <strong>"Delivery quantity cannot exceed the Maximum Monthly Production quantity multiplied by the number of months in the delivery period."</strong> can be fixed by an entry in the current cell so the highlight moves to this cell.</li>
      <li>Fix the error for this cell by changing the entry from <code>10</code> to <code>100</code>. Next click in the cell labeled <strong>"Enter the number of months over which deliveries will occur"</strong> and change the entry from <code>13</code> to <code>12</code>. All errors should now be cleared, however the <strong>"Submit"</strong> should not be enabled.</li>
      <li>Finally select a distribution profile and the <strong>"Submit"</strong> button should now be enabled because all required entries have been made and there are no errors. Click this button to open the second screen and see the resulting contract delivery schedule.</li>
